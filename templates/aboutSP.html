<h2 class="article-title">Srila Prabhupada: A Biography</h2>
<div class="container1">
    <div class="article">
        His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada was born in 1896 in Calcutta, India. He first met his
        spiritual master, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Gosvami, in Calcutta in 1922.
        Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati, a prominent devotional scholar and the founder of sixty-four branches of Gaudiya
        Mathas (Vedic institutes), liked this educated young man and convinced him to dedicate his life to teaching
        Vedic knowledge in the Western world. Srila Prabhupada became his student, and eleven years later (1933) at
        Allahabad, he became his formally initiated disciple.

        At their first meeting, in 1922, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura requested Srila Prabhupada to broadcast
        Vedic knowledge through the English language. In the years that followed, Srila Prabhupada wrote a commentary on
        the Bhagavad-gita and in 1944, without assistance, started an English fortnightly magazine.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Recognizing Srila Prabhupada's philosophical learning and devotion, the Gaudiya Vaisnava Society honored him in
        1947 with the title "Bhaktivedanta." In 1950, at the age of fifty-four, Srila Prabhupada retired from married
        life, and four years later he adopted the vanaprastha (retired) order to devote more time to his studies and
        writing. Srila Prabhupada traveled to the holy city of Vrndavana, where he lived in very humble circumstances in
        the historic medieval temple of Radha-Damodara. There he engaged for several years in deep study and writing. He
        accepted the renounced order of life (sannyasa) in 1959. At Radha-Damodara, Srila Prabhupada began work on his
        life's masterpiece: a multivolume translation and commentary on the 18,000-verse Srimad-Bhagavatam (Bhagavata
        Purana). He also wrote Easy Journey to Other Planets.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        After publishing three volumes of Bhagavatam, Srila Prabhupada came to the United States, in 1965, to fulfill
        the mission of his spiritual master. Since that time, His Divine Grace has written over sixty volumes of
        authoritative translations, commentaries and summary studies of the philosophical and religious classics of
        India.

        In 1965, at the age of seventy that he would set off on his mission to the West.Abhay Charan, now known as
        Bhaktivedanta Swami (an honorary title awarded by his peers), was given free passage aboard a cargo ship to New
        York. The journey proved to be treacherous, and he suffered two heart attacks while on the ship. After 35 days
        at sea he finally arrived at a lonely Brooklyn pier with just seven dollars in Indian rupees and one crate of
        his translations of sacred Sanskrit texts.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>

        In New York he faced great hardships, and was regularly without money and a steady place to live. He began his
        mission humbly, giving classes on the Bhagavad-gita in lofts in the Bowery (New York’s infamous skid row), and
        leading kirtan (traditional devotional chants) in Tompkins Square Park. His message of peace and goodwill
        resonated strongly with the hippie community and younger generation, some of whom came forward to become serious
        students of the Bhakti-yoga (loving devotion to God) tradition. With the help of these followers, who
        affectionately began calling Bhaktivedanta Swami “Swamiji,” a small storefront was rented on New York’s Lower
        East Side to use as a temple. In July 1966, After almost a year of adversity and struggle, Swamiji established
        the International Society for Krishna Consciousness for the purpose of working for real unity and peace and
        reinstating proper values in the world.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        He taught that each soul is part and parcel of the quality of God and that one could find true happiness through
        living a simpler, more natural way of life and dedicating one’s energy in the service of God and all living
        beings.Having begun initiating his New York followers into the Gaudiya Vaishnava lineage (the line of
        Bhakti-yoga stemming from the 16th century saint Sri Krishna Caitanya), Swamiji next travelled to San Francisco.
        Amidst the emerging hippie community in the Haight-Ashbury district, during 1967’s “Summer of Love,” he taught
        that the experience of devotion through Bhakti-yoga was a spiritual “high” superior to any pleasures derived
        from material sources such as wealth, fame, or intoxication. In the following months, many more people came
        forward to study under him and assist him.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Desiring to address him with the respect due to a revered spiritual teacher, his disciples began to call him
        Srila Prabhupada, meaning “one at whose feet the masters sit”.In the eleven years that followed, Srila
        Prabhupada circled the globe fourteen times, bringing the teachings of Bhakti-yoga to many thousands of people
        across all six continents. Men and women of all ages and backgrounds accepted his message and integrated the
        teachings into their lives. With his disciples’ help, Srila Prabhupada established centers and projects
        throughout the world, including temples, rural communities, educational institutions, and what would become the
        world’s largest food relief program (which happens to be vegetarian). Srila Prabhupada returned to India several
        times where he sparked a revival of the Bhakti-yoga tradition and opened many temples, including important
        centers in the holy towns of Vrindavana and Mayapur.Srila Prabhupada’s most significant contribution, however,
        is his books.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        He authored over seventy authentic volumes on Bhakti-yoga, which are highly respected for their authority,
        depth, clarity, and fidelity to tradition. His writings have been translated into seventy-six languages and are
        used as standard textbooks in most colleges around the world. His most prominent works include:Bhagavad-gita As
        It Is, the thirty-volume Srimad-Bhagavatam, and the seventeen-volume Sri Caitanya-caritamrita. To see the list
        of all books toggle “Books by Srila Prabhupada”.A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada left this world on November
        14, 1977 in the holy town of Vrindavan.
