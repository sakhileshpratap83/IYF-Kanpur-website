                        His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada was born in 1896 in Calcutta, India. He
                        first met his
                        spiritual master, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Gosvami, in Calcutta in 1922.
                        Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati, a prominent devotional scholar and the founder of sixty-four branches
                        of Gaudiya
                        Mathas (Vedic institutes), liked this educated young man and convinced him to dedicate his life
                        to teaching
                        Vedic knowledge in the Western world. Srila Prabhupada became his student, and eleven years
                        later (1933) at
                        Allahabad, he became his formally initiated disciple.

                        At their first meeting, in 1922, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura requested Srila
                        Prabhupada to broadcast
                        Vedic knowledge through the English language. In the years that followed, Srila Prabhupada wrote
                        a commentary on
                        the Bhagavad-gita and in 1944, without assistance, started an English fortnightly magazine.

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Recognizing Srila Prabhupada's philosophical learning and devotion, the Gaudiya Vaisnava Society
                        honored him in
                        1947 with the title "Bhaktivedanta." In 1950, at the age of fifty-four, Srila Prabhupada retired
                        from married
                        life, and four years later he adopted the vanaprastha (retired) order to devote more time to his
                        studies and
                        writing. Srila Prabhupada traveled to the holy city of Vrndavana, where he lived in very humble
                        circumstances in
                        the historic medieval temple of Radha-Damodara. There he engaged for several years in deep study
                        and writing. He
                        accepted the renounced order of life (sannyasa) in 1959. At Radha-Damodara, Srila Prabhupada
                        began work on his
                        life's masterpiece: a multivolume translation and commentary on the 18,000-verse
                        Srimad-Bhagavatam (Bhagavata
                        Purana). He also wrote Easy Journey to Other Planets.

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        After publishing three volumes of Bhagavatam, Srila Prabhupada came to the United States, in
                        1965, to fulfill
                        the mission of his spiritual master. Since that time, His Divine Grace has written over sixty
                        volumes of
                        authoritative translations, commentaries and summary studies of the philosophical and religious
                        classics of
                        India.

                        In 1965, at the age of seventy that he would set off on his mission to the West.Abhay Charan,
                        now known as
                        Bhaktivedanta Swami (an honorary title awarded by his peers), was given free passage aboard a
                        cargo ship to New
                        York. The journey proved to be treacherous, and he suffered two heart attacks while on the ship.
                        After 35 days
                        at sea he finally arrived at a lonely Brooklyn pier with just seven dollars in Indian rupees and
                        one crate of
                        his translations of sacred Sanskrit texts.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        In New York he faced great hardships, and was regularly without money and a steady place to
                        live. He began his
                        mission humbly, giving classes on the Bhagavad-gita in lofts in the Bowery (New York’s infamous
                        skid row), and
                        leading kirtan (traditional devotional chants) in Tompkins Square Park. His message of peace and
                        goodwill
                        resonated strongly with the hippie community and younger generation, some of whom came forward
                        to become serious
                        students of the Bhakti-yoga (loving devotion to God) tradition. With the help of these
                        followers, who
                        affectionately began calling Bhaktivedanta Swami “Swamiji,” a small storefront was rented on New
                        York’s Lower
                        East Side to use as a temple. In July 1966, After almost a year of adversity and struggle,
                        Swamiji established
                        the International Society for Krishna Consciousness for the purpose of working for real unity
                        and peace and
                        reinstating proper values in the world.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        He taught that each soul is part and parcel of the quality of God and that one could find true
                        happiness through
                        living a simpler, more natural way of life and dedicating one’s energy in the service of God and
                        all living
                        beings.Having begun initiating his New York followers into the Gaudiya Vaishnava lineage (the
                        line of
                        Bhakti-yoga stemming from the 16th century saint Sri Krishna Caitanya), Swamiji next travelled
                        to San Francisco.
                        Amidst the emerging hippie community in the Haight-Ashbury district, during 1967’s “Summer of
                        Love,” he taught
                        that the experience of devotion through Bhakti-yoga was a spiritual “high” superior to any
                        pleasures derived
                        from material sources such as wealth, fame, or intoxication. In the following months, many more
                        people came
                        forward to study under him and assist him.

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Desiring to address him with the respect due to a revered spiritual teacher, his disciples began
                        to call him
                        Srila Prabhupada, meaning “one at whose feet the masters sit”.In the eleven years that followed,
                        Srila
                        Prabhupada circled the globe fourteen times, bringing the teachings of Bhakti-yoga to many
                        thousands of people
                        across all six continents. Men and women of all ages and backgrounds accepted his message and
                        integrated the
                        teachings into their lives. With his disciples’ help, Srila Prabhupada established centers and
                        projects
                        throughout the world, including temples, rural communities, educational institutions, and what
                        would become the
                        world’s largest food relief program (which happens to be vegetarian). Srila Prabhupada returned
                        to India several
                        times where he sparked a revival of the Bhakti-yoga tradition and opened many temples, including
                        important
                        centers in the holy towns of Vrindavana and Mayapur.Srila Prabhupada’s most significant
                        contribution, however,
                        is his books.
